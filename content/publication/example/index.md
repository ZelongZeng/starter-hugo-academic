abstract: Most person re-identification (ReID) approaches assume that person
  images are captured under relatively similar illumination conditions. In
  reality, long-term person retrieval is common, and person images are often
  captured under different illumination conditions at different times across a
  day. In this situation, the performances of existing ReID models often degrade
  dramatically. This paper addresses the ReID problem with illumination
  variations and names it as Illumination-Adaptive Person Re-identification
  (IA-ReID). We propose an Illumination-Identity Disentanglement (IID) network
  to dispel different scales of illuminations away while preserving individuals'
  identity information. To demonstrate the illumination issue and to evaluate
  our model, we construct two large-scale simulated datasets with a wide range
  of illumination variations. Experimental results on the simulated datasets and
  real-world images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.
