abstract: Person re-identification has received much attention in the last few
  years, as it enhances the retrieval effectiveness in the video surveillance
  networks and video archive management. In this paper, we demonstrate a guiding
  robot with person followers system, which recognizes the follower using a
  person re-identification technology. It first adopts existing face recognition
  and person tracking methods to generate person tracklets with different IDs.
  Then, a classic person re-identification model, pre-trained on the
  surveillance dataset, is adapted to the new robot vision condition
  incrementally. The demonstration showcases the quality of robot follower
  focusing.
